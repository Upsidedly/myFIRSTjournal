JavaBlocks, often just called Blocks, is a visual programming language designed for teams in the FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) and FIRST Global Challenge (FGC). It runs on the REV Control Hub and can be accessed by connecting to the hub's Wi-Fi network and opening a browser. You don't need to install anything else â€” it's all built-in.

Blocks works by letting you drag and drop puzzle-like pieces of code instead of writing text. This makes it beginner-friendly and perfect for those who are new to coding or just want to quickly test ideas without worrying about syntax errors.

With Blocks, you can:
- Control motors and servos
- Read sensors like distance sensors, color sensors, and gyros
- Make decisions using logic
- Build full autonomous and driver-controlled programs

Under the hood, Blocks is actually generating Java code. This means it's a great way to learn programming fundamentals and transition smoothly to OnBot Java or Android Studio Java/Kotlin later on.

It's not just for beginners, though: plenty of experienced teams use Blocks to build competitive bots. It's fast, reliable, and gets the job done.
