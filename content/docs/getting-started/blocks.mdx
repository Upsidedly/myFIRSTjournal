JavaBlocks (often just called **Blocks**) is a super fun visual programming language! 🌟
It's designed for FTC and FGC teams and runs right on your REV Control Hub. Just connect
to the hub's Wi-Fi, open a browser, and you're ready to go — no installation needed! 🚀

Blocks works by letting you drag and drop puzzle-like pieces of code instead of writing text. This makes it beginner-friendly and perfect for those who are new to coding or just want to quickly test ideas without worrying about syntax errors.

With Blocks, you can:
- Control motors and servos
- Read sensors like distance sensors, color sensors, and gyros
- Make decisions using logic
- Build full autonomous and driver-controlled programs

Under the hood, Blocks is actually generating Java code. This means it's a great way to learn programming fundamentals and transition smoothly to OnBot Java or Android Studio Java/Kotlin later on.

It's not just for beginners, though: plenty of experienced teams use Blocks to build competitive bots. It's fast, reliable, and gets the job done.
