## Overview

In the FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC), programming is what brings your robot to life! 🌟
It controls how your robot moves, senses, and performs tasks on the field. Without it,
even the most sophisticated robot would just sit there looking pretty. Let's dive in! 🏊
programming, teams develop software that interprets sensor input, manages
hardware components such as motors and servos, and executes strategies both
autonomously and under driver control. In both FTC and the FIRST Global
Challenge (FGC), programming is conducted using JavaBlocks, OnBotJava, Android
Studio (Java), or Kotlin. Ultimately, programming serves as the bridge between
mechanical design and game strategy, transforming a collection of parts into an
intelligent, responsive machine.

## Choosing Your Programming Environment

Programming environments vary greatly in terms of complexity, ease of use, and
available features. Here's a quick guide to help you pick:

### JavaBlocks

[=>JavaBlocks](/docs/getting-started/blocks)

- **Ideal for beginners** who are completely new to programming.
- Visually intuitive drag-and-drop interface.
- Excellent for understanding basic programming concepts quickly.
- Limited functionality for more complex algorithms.

### OnBotJava

[=>OnBotJava](/docs/getting-started/onbotjava)

- **Great for teams starting to explore Java.**
- Browser-based interface.
- No additional software installation needed.
- Suitable for moderately complex programs but limited compared to Android
  Studio.

### Android Studio (Java & Kotlin)

[=>Android Studio](/docs/getting-started/android-studio)

- **Recommended for advanced teams** who want more control and customization.
- Full-featured IDE supporting Java and Kotlin.
- Advanced debugging tools, version control, and integration with libraries.
- Slightly steeper learning curve but highly rewarding.

## Basic Programming Concepts

FTC programming primarily involve:
- **Initialization**: Configuring hardware components such as motors, servos,
  sensors, and controllers.
- **Control Loops**: Running continuous loops to manage robot behavior during
  autonomous and tele-operated periods.
- **Event Handling**: Managing robot reactions to gamepad input and sensor
  feedback.

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Test individual components before integrating complex
   behaviors.
2. **Version Control**: Use tools like Git to manage your team's codebase.
3. **Comments and Documentation**: Clearly comment your code to improve
   readability and teamwork.
4. **Consistency**: Establish coding standards to ensure team-wide consistency.
