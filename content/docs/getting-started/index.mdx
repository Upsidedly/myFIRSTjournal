# Overview

Without programming within robotics, each and every robot would be expensive paperweights, no? Programming in FTC and FGC consists of code written through JavaBlocks, OnBotJava, Android Studio Java, or Kotlin.

## Choosing Your Programming Environment

Programming environments vary greatly in terms of complexity, ease of use, and available features. Here's a quick guide to help you pick:

### JavaBlocks 

<SeeMain href="/docs/getting-started/blocks" />

* **Ideal for beginners** who are completely new to programming.
* Visually intuitive drag-and-drop interface.
* Excellent for understanding basic programming concepts quickly.
* Limited functionality for more complex algorithms.

### OnBotJava

{/* <SeeMain href="/" /> */}

* **Great for teams starting to explore Java.**
* Browser-based interface.
* No additional software installation needed.
* Suitable for moderately complex programs but limited compared to Android Studio.

### Android Studio (Java & Kotlin)

{/* <SeeMain href="/" /> */}

* **Recommended for advanced teams** who want more control and customization.
* Full-featured IDE supporting Java and Kotlin.
* Advanced debugging tools, version control, and integration with libraries.
* Slightly steeper learning curve but highly rewarding.

## Basic Programming Concepts

FTC and FGC programming primarily involve:

* **Initialization**: Configuring hardware components such as motors, servos, sensors, and controllers.
* **Control Loops**: Running continuous loops to manage robot behavior during autonomous and tele-operated periods.
* **Event Handling**: Managing robot reactions to gamepad input and sensor feedback.

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Test individual components before integrating complex behaviors.
2. **Version Control**: Use tools like Git to manage your team's codebase.
3. **Comments and Documentation**: Clearly comment your code to improve readability and teamwork.
4. **Consistency**: Establish coding standards to ensure team-wide consistency.
