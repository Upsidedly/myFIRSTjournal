# 📖 Dictionary Reference Example

This page demonstrates the dictionary reference feature using double brackets.

## How It Works

When you write a word in double brackets like [[robot]], it will become an interactive term that shows a definition when you hover over it.

You can also use custom display text with the pipe syntax: [[First Tech Challenge|ftc]] displays "First Tech Challenge" but uses the "ftc" dictionary entry.

## Examples

Here are some examples:

- A [[servo]] is used for precise angular control
- [[FTC]] is a robotics competition for middle and high school students
- The [[First Tech Challenge|ftc]] is great for learning robotics
- During [[autonomous]], the robot operates without driver input
- [[TeleOp]] is when drivers control the robot
- A [[motor]] converts electrical energy to motion
- [[PID]] controllers help with precise movement
- [[Odometry]] helps track robot position
- [[Sensor]] devices detect environmental inputs

## Custom Display Text

You can display different text while still using the dictionary definition:

- The [[proportional-integral-derivative controller|pid]] is essential for smooth motion
- We use [[motors|motor]] and [[servos|servo]] in our robot
- The [[driver-controlled period|teleop]] comes after autonomous

## Undefined Terms

If you reference a term that's not in the dictionary, like [[undefined-term]], it will just display in brackets without the interactive tooltip.

## Add More Terms

You can add more dictionary entries in `src/lib/dictionary.ts`.
