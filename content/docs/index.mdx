title: What is myFIRSTjournal?
---

<Wordmark /> is a student-led website designed to share tips, tricks, and
insights related to programming in both the **FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC)** and the
**FIRST Global Challenge (FGC)**. All content is created and maintained by students
actively participating in these competitions.

<Callout>
This site is not officially affiliated with FIRST. It is also made in the assumption that all users have an understanding of what FIRST, FTC, and FGC are.
</Callout>

The information shared here is based on both factual sources and firsthand experience.
Even if an issue only occurs one out of ten times, it will still be documented, as
in robotics, the edge cases matter.

Some pages may recompile and rephrase information from various sources to make it more
accessible or relevant. However, if an existing resource already covers a topic
thoroughly and clearly, we will link to it directly instead of rewriting it.
Additionally, sources and references used in each page will be listed where applicable.

<Callout type="warn" title="Note">
Throughout this handbook, only FTC will be referenced by name.
Unless otherwise noted, all information applies equally to both FTC and FGC.

FTC primarily uses Java (and occasionally Kotlin) for programming, whereas FGC relies mainly on JavaBlocks, with some teams using OnBotJava. References to
Challenge relies mainly on JavaBlocks, with some teams using OnBotJava. References to
external hardware not included in the official FGC kit may therefore not
apply to that competition.

## Philosophy

The goal of <Wordmark /> is to make technical knowledge in FIRST robotics more accessible, accurate, and student-driven. Many programming concepts are scattered across forums, videos, and codebases — this site unifies them into a single, structured reference built from real competition experience.


## Maintainers

The site is currently maintained by:

- Matthew Williams ([FGC Jamaica](https://fgcjamaica.github.io/), [FTC 16075](https://ftcscout.org/teams/16075))
