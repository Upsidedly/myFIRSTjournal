title: What is myFIRSTjournal?

## Overview

<Wordmark /> is a student-led website designed to share tips, tricks, and
insights related to programming in both the **FIRST Tech Challenge** and the
**FIRST Global Challenge**. All content is created and maintained by students
actively participating in these competitions.

The information shared here is based on both factual sources and firsthand experience.
Even if an issue only occurs one out of ten times, it will still be documented, as
in robotics, the edge cases matter.

Some pages may recompile and rephrase information from various sources to make it more
accessible or relevant. However, if an existing resource already covers a topic
thoroughly and clearly, we will link to it directly instead of rewriting it.
Additionally, sources and references used in each page will be listed where applicable.

Throughout this documentation, only FTC (FIRST Tech Challenge) will be referenced by name.
However, unless stated otherwise, all information should be assumed to apply equally to both
the FIRST Tech Challenge and the FIRST Global Challenge.

## Maintainers

The site is currently maintained by:

- Matthew Williams ([FGC Jamaica](https://fgcjamaica.github.io/), [FTC 16075](https://ftcscout.org/teams/16075))
